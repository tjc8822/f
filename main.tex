\begin{itemize}
\item for a large class of incomplete market models with aggregate and idiosyncratic risks,  characterize the conditions under which 
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item equilibrium prices and quantities can be obtained from those in a \bewley with only idiosyncratic risk 
\vspace{5mm}
\item make contact to the aggregation literature
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\item given the equivalence results, heterogeneity does not matter for 
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item equity premium
\vspace{5mm}
\item wealth inequality over business cycles
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}%[<+->]
\item lay out the physical environment
\vspace{5mm}
\item consider a two-period example: full analytical solution to develop intuitions for main results
\vspace{5mm}
\item the infinite horizon version:
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item describe the stationary model with only idiosyncratic risk (\textit{Bewley model})
\vspace{5mm}
\item \arrow: with aggregate uncertainty,  agents can trade stock and Arrow securities
\vspace{5mm}
\item show how to construct allocations and prices in the \arrow using the solutions to the \textit{Bewley model}; analyze asset pricing implications
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}%[<+->]
\item aggregate shock $z_t$, idiosyncratic shock $y_t$, $s_t = (y_t,z_t),  s^t = (y^t,z^t)$ shocks follow a first order Markov process: $\pi(s^\prime|s)$
\vspace{5mm}
\item aggregate endowment $e_t(z^t)$, its growth rate $\lambda(z^{t+1}) = \frac{e_{t+1}(z^{t+1})}{e_{t}(z^{t})}$
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item assume that $\lambda(z^{t+1}) = \lambda(z_{t+1})$
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\item $\alpha(z_t)e_t(z^t)$ is capital income: a Lucas tree that yields $\alpha(z_t)e_t(z^t)$ as capital income 
\vspace{5mm}
\item $(1-\alpha(z_t))e_t(z^t)$ is labor income: individual labor income process $\{\eta_t\}$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_t(s^t) = (1-\alpha(z_t))e_t(z^t) \times \eta(y_t, z_t)
\end{equation*}

\begin{frame}{infinite horizon: key assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item independence of idiosyncratic shocks from aggregate conditions:\vspace{5mm} 
\begin{itemize}
\item individual labor endowment shares:  $\eta(y_t, z_t) = \eta(y_t)$
\vspace{5mm}
\item for the growth-adjusted probability 

\begin{equation*}
\hpi(s_{t+1}|s_t)=\psi(y_{t+1}|y_t)\hphi(z_{t+1}|z_t), \quad\text{and}\quad \hphi(z_{t+1}|z_t) = \frac{\phi(z_{t+1}|z_t)\lambda(z_{t+1})^{1-\gamma}}{\sum_{z_{t+1}}\phi(z_{t+1}|z_t)\lambda(z_{t+1})^{1-\gamma}}
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2mm}
\item aggregate endowment growth is i.i.d: $\phi(z_{t+1}|z_t)=\phi(z_{t+1})$
\vspace{5mm} 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\hphi(z_{t+1}|z_t)=\hphi(z_{t+1})$, $\hbeta(z_t) = \hbeta$

\item agents maximize utility given budge constraints
\begin{equation*}
\hc_t(y^t) + \frac{\ha_t(y^t)}{\hR_t} + \hsigma_t(y^t)\hv_t = (1-\alpha)\eta(y_t) + \ha_{t-1}(y^{t-1})+\hsigma_{t-1}(y^{t-1})(\hv_t+\alpha)

\vspace{2mm}
\item agents also face one of two types of borrowing constraints (or both)
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
&\frac{\ha_t(\yt)}{\hR_t}+\hsigma_t(\yt)\hv_t\geq \hK_t(\yt)\quad \forall \yt \\

\begin{frame}{equivalence results}
\begin{theorem}
If $\{ \hc_t(\theta_0,y^t), \ha_t(\theta_0,y^t), \hsigma_t(\theta_0,y^t)\}$ and $\{\hR_t, \hv_t\}$ is an equilibrium of the \bewley, then$ \{a_t(\theta_0,s^t,z_{t+1})), \sigma_t(\theta_0,s^t), c_t(\theta_0, s^t)\}$ and $\{q_t(z^t,z_{t+1}), v_t(z^t) \}$ is an equilibrium of the stochastically growing \arrow with
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item $c_t(\theta_0,s^t) = \hc(\theta_0,y^t)e_t(z^t)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $\sigma_t(\theta_0,s^t)=\hsigma_t(\theta_0,y^t)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $a_t(\theta_0, s^t, z_{t+1}) = \ha_t(\theta_0, y^t)e_{t+1}(z^{t+1})$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $v_t(z^t)=\hv_t e_t(z^t)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $q_t(z^t, z_{t+1})= \frac{1}{\hR_t}\times \frac{\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{-\gamma}}{\sum_{z_{t+1}}\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{1-\gamma}}$
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item in a \textbf{de-trended} \arrow, its equilibrium allocations are identical to those in a stationary \bewley 
\vspace{5mm}
\item aggregate uncertainty does not interact with normalized wealth distribution
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{some properties of equilibrium price/allocations}
\begin{itemize}

\item note that in the de-trended \arrow, $\ha^{A}_t(\theta_0, s^t, z_{t+1}) = \ha_t(\theta_0,y^t) = 0$ 
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item  the position on state contingent asset is not contingent at all
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\item Also note that the pd ratio is constant: not surprising given constant capital income share, i.i.d aggregate shock and constant Sharpe ratio I am about to show
\vspace{5mm}
\item for the normalized \arrow, why do agents behave as if there is no aggregate uncertainty at all?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Asset pricing results}
\begin{itemize}
\item By the equivalence results, the equilibrium state price density is 
\begin{equation}
q_t(z^t, z_{t+1})= \frac{1}{\hR_t\sum_{z_{t+1}}\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{1-\gamma}} \times\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{-\gamma}
\end{equation}

\vspace{3mm}
\item the state price density in a representative agent economy:
\begin{equation}
q_t^{RA}(z^t,z_{t+1}) = {\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{-\gamma}}
\end{equation}

\vspace{3mm}
\item  HJ bound immediately tells us that
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sharpe-ratio is identical in $\arrow$ and representative-agent economy 
\vspace{3mm}
\item risk-premium is constant
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{other extensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The equivalence results can be extended to an economy with aggregate uncertainty, in which agents can trade stock and one period un-contingent bond
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item not surprising given that in the \arrow, their positions on state contingent bonds already exhibit state-uncontingency
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
\item relaxation of non-predictability in the aggregate state. Without solvency constraints, the asset pricing irrelevance results hold
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item can connect to earlier results documented in KS(1997) and KS(1998)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
\item permanent individual income shocks: all results go through
\vspace{3mm}
\item time-varying factor income shares: when the labor income has a second component as in the 2-period model, the results survive
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{A two-period example}
\begin{itemize}
\item agents all start with initial wealth $\theta_0$ (1 share of Lucas tree, 0 positions on Arrow securities), initial state $s_0 = (z_0, y_0)$

\item agent chooses $\{c_0(s_0), c_1(s^1) \}$, $\{ a_0(s_0, z_1=z_l), a_0(s_0, z_1=z_h)\}$ $\sigma_0$

\vspace{5mm}
\item $c_1(s^1) = [(1-\alpha(z_1))\eta(y_1,z_1)+\alpha(z_1)]e_1(z^1), \forall s^1$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Irrelevance results in the two period example}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Independence of idiosyncratic shocks and aggregate shocks: 
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item  $\eta(y_1,z_1) = \eta(y_1)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item  $\pi(y_1|z_1)=\pi(y_1)$ \textbf{but this does not imply that $\pi(y_1|y_0)=\pi(y_1)$}
\vspace{3mm}
\item rule out the Counter-Cyclical cross-sectional variance of income shocks (CCV) mechanism as in CD
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
\item constant capital income share: $\alpha(z_1) = \alpha$
now  the ratio of IMRS is 
\begin{equation}\label{2_period_intermiediate_step}
\frac{\sum_{y_1}\pi(y_1)m([(1-\alpha)\eta(y_1)+\alpha])\lambda(z_h)e_0,e_0)}{\sum_{y_1}\pi(y_1)m([(1-\alpha)\eta(y_1)+\alpha])\lambda(z_l)e_0,e_0)}
\end{equation}
\vspace{3mm}
\item homogeneity of period utility function: take CRRA utility as an example, equation \ref{2_period_intermiediate_step} becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sum_{y_1}\pi(y_1)m([(1-\alpha)\eta(y_1)+\alpha]),1)\times \lambda(z_h)^{-\gamma}}{\sum_{y_1}\pi(y_1)m([(1-\alpha)\eta(y_1)+\alpha]),1)\times \lambda(z_l)^{-\gamma}} = \frac{\lambda(z_h)^{-\gamma}}{\lambda(z_l)^{-\gamma}}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\end{equation*}
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{equation*}
