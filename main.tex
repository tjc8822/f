\begin{frame}{What is this paper about}
\begin{itemize}
\item for a large class of incomplete market models with aggregate and idiosyncratic risks,  characterize the conditions under which 
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item equilibrium prices and quantities can be obtained from those in a \bewley with only idiosyncratic risk 
\vspace{5mm}
\item make contact to the aggregation literature
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\item given the equivalence results, heterogeneity does not matter for 
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item equity premium
\vspace{5mm}
\item wealth inequality over business cycles
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
\item quickly review some notations
\vspace{5mm}
\item the general results in the infinite horizon economy:
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item discuss the equilibrium concept carefully in the \bewley
\vspace{5mm}
\item show how to construct equilibrium allocations and prices in the \arrow using the equilibrium outcomes in the \bewley 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
\item if we have time, bridge the gap between the two-period example and the general results

\vspace{5mm}
\item $\alpha(z_t)e_t(z^t)$ is capital income: stock represents a claim to capital income
\vspace{5mm}
\item $(1-\alpha(z_t))e_t(z^t)$ is labor income: individual labor income process $\{\eta_t\}$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_t(s^t) = (1-\alpha(z_t))e_t(z^t) \times \eta(y_t, z_t)

\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{theorem}
If $\{ \hc_t(\theta_0,y^t), \ha_t(\theta_0,y^t), \hsigma_t(\theta_0,y^t)\}$ and $\{\hR_t, \hv_t\}$ is an equilibrium of the \bewley, then$ \{a_t(\theta_0,s^t,z_{t+1})), \sigma_t(\theta_0,s^t), c_t(\theta_0, s^t)\}$ and $\{q_t(z^t,z_{t+1}), v_t(z^t) \}$ is an equilibrium of the stochastically growing \arrow with
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item $c_t(\theta_0,s^t) = \hc(\theta_0,y^t)e_t(z^t)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $\sigma_t(\theta_0,s^t)=\hsigma_t(\theta_0,y^t)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $a_t(\theta_0, s^t, z_{t+1}) = \ha_t(\theta_0, y^t)e_{t+1}(z^{t+1})$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $v_t(z^t)=\hv_t e_t(z^t)$
\vspace{3mm}
\item $q_t(z^t, z_{t+1})= \frac{1}{\hR_t}\times \frac{\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{-\gamma}}{\sum_{z_{t+1}}\phi(z_{t+1})\lambda(z_{t+1})^{1-\gamma}}$
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item in a \textbf{de-trended} \arrow, its equilibrium allocations are identical to those in a  \bewley 
\vspace{5mm}
\item aggregate uncertainty does not interact with normalized wealth distribution
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{sketch of proof}
\begin{itemize}
\item to jointly solve for allocations and prices is complicated in \arrow
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item conjecture a constant pd ratio in \arrow
\vspace{5mm}
\item guess that Arrow securities' prices in \arrow is given by multiplying Arrow securities' prices in a representative agent economy with some constant
\vspace{5mm}
\item plug the conjectured prices into the Euler equations and complementary-slackness conditions in the \arrow
\vspace{5mm}
\item it turns out that the optimal allocations in the \bewley satisfies those optimality conditions, under conjectured prices
\vspace{5mm}
\item also market clearing conditions coincide in the \bewley and de-trended \arrow
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{intuition for the i.i.d aggregate endowment growth assumption}
\begin{itemize}
\item the i.i.d aggregate endowment growth assumption alone may already imply that the distribution is not a relevant state variable
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item with i.i.d aggregate endowment growth rate, no predictable component in agents' wealth;
\vspace{5mm}
\item therefore, there is no predictable component in individual agents' marginal utility (value) of wealth; 
\vspace{5mm}
\item without such predicable component in wealth due to the lack of predictability in aggregate shock, we expect that once scaled out aggregate endowment, the normalized wealth distribution coincide with that in a \bewley. Therefore, the wealth distribution does not matter.
\vspace{5mm}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{the connection between the general results to the two period model in the paper}

\begin{itemize}
\item recall that for the two period model: ex-ante homogeneity leads to a no trade (in stocks and bonds) autarkic equilibrium
\vspace{5mm}
\item from the general results to the allocations in the two period model
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item start with the same degenerate wealth distribution as in the 2-period model
\vspace{5mm}
\item compute the competitive equilibrium at $t=0$ in the \bewley
\vspace{5mm}
\item scale people's allocations and prices properly by the main theorem
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
